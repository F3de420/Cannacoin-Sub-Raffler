## Overview

**Cannacoin-Sub-Raffler** is a simple yet effective command-line tool that allows users to randomly select winners from comments on a specific Reddit post. This tool is particularly useful for giveaways, contests, and raffles held on Reddit. The script uses the [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library to interact with Reddit's API.

### Features

- Fetches comments from a specified Reddit post.
- Excludes specific users based on input.
- Randomly selects a specified number of winners.
- Displays eligible commenters and excluded users.
- Color-coded terminal output for better readability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library
