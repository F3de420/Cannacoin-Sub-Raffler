### How to Start a Raffle

#### Syntax:

```
plaintext


Copia codice
!raffle w <number_of_winners> r <reward1;reward2;reward3...>
```

#### Example:

- `!raffle w 3 r 10000;5000;1000`: Launch a raffle with 3 winners. The first winner receives 10000, the second 5000, and the third 1000.

#### Default Behavior:

- If no parameters are specified, the bot will default to 1 winner with no rewards.

------

### Command Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `w <number>`     | Defines the number of winners (default is 1).                |
| `r <reward;...>` | Specifies rewards per place, separated by `;`. Additional winners receive the last reward specified. |

**Note**: The bot enforces limits on the number of winners and reward amounts as specified in `bot_config.json`.

### Bot Behavior in Specific Situations

1. **Flood Control**:
   - Users can trigger a raffle every 10 minutes to prevent spam. Any excess commands are ignored, and the administrator receives a notification.
2. **Eligibility Check**:
   - The bot checks account age, karma, and other requirements before a user can participate. Ineligible participants are excluded automatically.
3. **Error and Feedback**:
   - Invalid commands or configurations prompt the bot to notify the designated administrator directly, ensuring smooth operations and troubleshooting.
4. **Multiple Subreddit Support**:
   - The bot can monitor multiple subreddits concurrently and will respond to valid raffle commands in each.

------

### Troubleshooting

If the bot stops or isnâ€™t responding as expected:

1. **Check Logs**: Refer to `bot.log` for any errors or warnings.
2. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure `bot_config.json` is correctly set up, and environment variables are properly defined.
3. **Restart the Bot**: Stop the bot and relaunch it by running `python Cannacoin-Sub-Raffler.py`.
